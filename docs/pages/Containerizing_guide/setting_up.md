summary: Setting up a model for containerization
---


## 1. File structure


**If you have a file that holds all of your configuration, I would highly suggest you keep that in the `client` folder instead of inside your containerization folder. Justification can be found [here](https://fossilizedcontainers.github.io/fossilized-controller/adding_adapter.html#41-config-files)**

## 2. Container folder

### 2.1 Adapter library

### 2.2 Main code

### 2.3 Environment file

## 3. Client folder

### 3.1 Input files

### 3.2 Metadata

#### 3.2.1 Parameters
**Even if you are not using our parameters functionality, you should still have a section in the metadata file for parameters even if it is empty.**

#### 3.2.2 Inputs

We are now ready to modify our main file so that is it adapter ready
